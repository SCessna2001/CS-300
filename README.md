SNHU CS-300 Projects

1. What was the problem you were solving in projects for this course? 
The projects that we were solving in this course was figuring out the uses for the different types of lists to be sorted alphanumerically and outputed in order.

2. How did you approach the problem? 
I approached this problem by analyising the different types of list and what the output requirements were and narrowed down which list was better by looking at the pros and cons for each list.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through this activity?
I overcame any roadblocks that I had by revisiting the textbook and re-doing the activities and re-reading the section I was stuck on.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project has helped me expand my approach by using run-time analysis charts as well as writing proper pseudocode for the tasks at hand.

5. How has this work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This work on this project has helped me evolve my ability to write programs by teaching the proper way to space, indent, and comment my work as I go to make it easier to re-read and fix/find any bugs or errors that may come up.
